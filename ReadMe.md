# Cloud Computing Roadmap

Hi There, Hope you are feeling awesome today. This Repo have (will have) all my experience regarding Cloud Computing and DevOps.

I hope you enjoy going through it and please consider giving me your feedback.

## Linux Kernel :-

You must understand that all cloud services are Linux-based, So understanding how Linux work is the first step to understand cloud.

Meet your new friend: https://learntocloud.guide/
this tool is open source Make use of.

## Cloud Service Providers
	Best Way to learn about cloud providers is by DOING.
	Don't spend you own money but make use of the Academies
	offered by the cloud providers.
	
- ### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
	- AWS Solution Architect Course In Arabic
		- [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOoZRfEtk6kWSM_l9xMjDh-_MJXl03-pf) (Essa abo Sherif)
	- AWS Academy (Join [NTI](https://www.nti.sci.eg/dey/courses1m.php?catID=106) Training and you will get it for free) ***(No Need For Credit Card)***
	- You can use [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). The only problem you might face that ***it needs Credit Card Information***.

- ### Microsoft Azure
	- You can get $100 in credit using [Github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Use them to learn more about cloud services provided by azure.
	- ***It `doesn't need`  Credit Card Information***.
	- I Recommend One on these two playlist:
		- [Free4Arab](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLlr6jKKdyK1DptcME7IFXUdPCY4z9Q28)
		- [Mohammed Zohdy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxVq3TlR9y3D61tEq4BbRZ8f5bv2_PFt) (Longer and More Detailed)

- ### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
	- [Qwiklabs](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths)
	- Go to the [GDSC Community](https://www.facebook.com/DSC.MU) in you Campus and ask for a promo code for Qwiklabs Cloud paths and they will gladly provide it.
	- You can get $300 free credit on Google Cloud Platform using [Free Tier Plan](https://cloud.google.com/free). the only problem is that ***it needs Credit Card Information***.

Cloud isn't just monopolized by big tech players there are a lot of other cloud providers:

- ### Digital Ocean
	- 
- ### Linode

There are other cloud providers as well, but those are on top of my mind.
## Cloud Types:

#### There are 3 different types of cloud (+1 Bonus)
- **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS)
	- Cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- **Platform as a Service** (PaaS)
	- A complete development and deployment environment in the cloud.
- **Software as a Service** (SaaS)
	- Allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet

```

### Cloud vs VPS
- **Cloud Services ==> Pay-As-You-Go Services**
	- Very scalable and can be cost efficient
- **Virtual Private Servers ==> Fixed Monthly Fee**
	- Not So Scalable, can be expensive if not using resources.
