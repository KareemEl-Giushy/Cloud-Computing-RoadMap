| Preparing Environment | Create a Virtual Linux Machine using: <br>- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (Open Source)<br>- VMware (Closed Source)<br><br>Try Different Tastes of Linux:<br>- e.g. Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc<br><br>Check out: [Distro Timeline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/2023_Linux_Distributions_Timeline.svg)<br><br>- Once installation is complete, explore the built-in help features:<br>    <br>- Use man pages to research the `fstab` file.<br><br>- What are the differences between the various man page sections? Admins primarily use sections 1, 5, and 8—why?<br><br>- How can you do a keyword search within man pages?<br><br>- What can be found at `/usr/share/doc`?<br><br>- Explore whatever GUI help files might be available.<br><br>- Complete the Vim tutorial (the command is `vimtutor`) to get comfortable with [Vim](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/four-things-vim). You can use [Nano](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/four-things-nano) if you prefer. Be _certain_ you can create, open, edit, save, and close configuration files before proceeding any further with these activities.<br><br>- Try configuring the installations for a specific time zone by using the `tzselect` command. | How to install Linux in a virtual environment.<br><br>Understand booting kernel.<br><br>Develop an Understanding in Installing bootable Software.<br><br>Understand Basic Operations on Linux<br><br>Use Native Text Editor.<br><br>Understand Basic Operations |
| Cool Kids | Exit From Vim | اللي حضر العفريت  يصرفه يا صاحبي <br>😉 |
| Users & Permissions | - Adjust the privileges assigned to your user account by using the `sudo` command. You need to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file by using the `visudo` command. | Understand Where Configurations are Stored.<br><br>What is the Sudoers File. |
| Users & Permissions | - Use the `/etc/skel` directory to define profile settings before adding any user accounts.<br><br>- Set password and account expirations using the `/etc/login.defs` file before adding any user accounts. Use the following password requirements:<br><br>- Passwords should expire after 90 days, with a five-day warning period.<br><br>- Use the command line to [create five user accounts](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-user-group-management) to use in later activities. You will experiment with permissions and ownership by using these accounts. Give each user a unique name but set them all with the same password (for your own sanity).<br><br>- Use the command line to create five groups based on fictitious departments: sales, marketing, human resources, IT, engineering. Place one user from above into each group.<br><br>- Delegate the ability to reboot the system to only one user by using `sudo`. | Understand Users and Profiles.<br><br>Where Users Are Stored.<br><br>How to Manage Users.<br><br>How to Create New Users.<br><br>How Permissions Work in Linux Environment. |
| Directories & Permissions | - Create directories for each department (sales, marketing, human resources, IT, engineering) at the root of the filesystem.<br><br>- [Configure standard Linux permissions and ownership](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/manage-permissions) such that each group only has access to its own departmental directories. For example, the sales group has access to the `/sales` directory but not to other departments' directories.<br>    <br>- After completing and testing the previous step, [configure ACL permissions](https://opensource.com/article/20/3/external-drives-linux) to permit the marketing department to have read access to the `/sales` directory.<br><br>- Use ACL permissions to permit one user account to have read permission to the `/IT` directory<br><br>- Ensure that two of your existing user accounts are now members of the marketing group.<br><br>- Use each account to create one file in the `/marketing` directory.<br><br>- Test whether one of those accounts can delete the file created by the other account (they should not be able to, due to the sticky bit).<br><br>- Create a file called `unchangeable.txt`, set the immutable attribute on it, and then delete the file. | Know More About Directories.<br><br>Understand User Privileges.<br><br>Understand ACLs.<br><br>Understand Immutable Files. |
| Devices & File System | - At the command line only, practice mounting and unmounting ISO images. | Know more About Extensions and File Management in Linux. |
| File System | - Use the `find` command to search for files on the system. | Understand Directory Hierarchy System. |
| Software installation and Management | - Use your distro package manager to **install** software.<br><br>- Use the same package manager to **list** all available software.<br><br>- Use the same package manager to **delete** software. | Understand Package Managers and How They Work.<br><br>Know different ways to install software on Linux. |
| Software installation and Management | - Use Flatpaks to install software:<br> [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) (Open Source)<br><br>- Use Flatpak to l**ist** all installed software<br><br>- Use *Flatpak CLI* to **search for** a software<br><br>- Use *Flatpak CLI* to **uninstall** software | Understand What Are Flatpaks.<br><br>Know different ways to install software on Linux. |
| Software installation and Management | - Use AppImages to install software:<br>[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) (Open Source)<br>[AppImage Hub](https://www.appimagehub.com/) (Store) | Understand What Are AppImages.<br><br>Know different ways to install software on Linux. |
| Software installation and Management | ***Build Software Form Source***<br><br>- Find and download software that you must compile. Go through the process of compiling the software. (GitLab, GitHub, and Sourceforge are popular development repositories.)<br><br>- Download a piece of software that includes an MD5 checksum to verify its integrity. After the download, compare your MD5 results with the result on the website. | How to Deal With Open Source Software.<br><br>How to build Software From Source.<br><br>Know different ways to install software on Linux. |
